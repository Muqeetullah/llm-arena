# LLM Arena

Send one prompt to free OpenRouter models, compare their independently streamed answers, and vote for the best one.

## Local setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and provide Clerk, OpenRouter, Arcjet, PostHog, and PostgreSQL credentials.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Generate the Prisma client with `npm run prisma:generate`.
4. Start the app with `npm run dev`.

The model endpoint is `POST /api/model-responses`. It requires a Clerk session and accepts one free OpenRouter model per request. Multiple models must be called with separate concurrent requests so their streams fail and cancel independently.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
